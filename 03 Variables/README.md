# Python Variables

## 📖 Rules for Python Vars

* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
* A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

## Examples 

✅ Correct examples

```python
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

❌ Incorrect examples 

```py
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```
## Naming conventions 

### 🐫 camelCase 
```py
myVariableName = "John"
```

### 🎩 PascalCase 
```py
MyVariableName = "John"
```

### 🐍 snake_case
```py
my_variable_name = "John"
```
