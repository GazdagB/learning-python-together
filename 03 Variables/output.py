# x = "Python is awesome"
# print(x)
# Output: Python is awesome

# Outputs the same as the code above but with multiple variables

# a = "Python"
# b = "is"
# c = "awesome"
# print(a,b,c)

# This code demonstrates how to assign multiple variables in Python.
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)  # Output: 15

print("Hello World")  # Output: Hello World
# This code demonstrates how to assign multiple variables in Python.
