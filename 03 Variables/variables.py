# Python doesn't have a keyword for declaring variables
# Variables are created when you assign a value to them
x = 5 # Integer
y = "John" # String
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set
print(x) # Outputs: 5
print(y) # Outputs: John
